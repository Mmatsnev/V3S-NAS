# -= Makefile for module compile =-
#
# Usage:
# . Name this file as "Makefile";
#   Put it in the same directory as module's source code.
# . Change the ROOT definition, if necessary;
#   Make it point to the root of the software tree.
# . Define the Module Name in MOD as you like;
#   There should be NO duplicated module names in the whole project.
# . List all files want to be compiled in ASMS and/or SRCS;
#   Including files, such as header files, must NOT be listed here.
# . List all library files this module may depends on in LIBS.
# . Give a new name in SMOD, if want to include sub-directories;
#   Write the linkage information at the end of file.
